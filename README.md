# Dungeon-Runner
Dungeon Runner is a free-to-play (F2P), 2-10 player game, focusing on the PvE experience. Players will delve into dungeons (levels) and earn in-game rewards, and out-of-game rewards using Web3 Technology (DLT/Blockchains)

There are no current plans to introduce matchmaking or PvP experiences. If the framework proves viable, then the possibilities will be considered.

It will be finalized in a 3D engine. Currently, the engine of choice is Unity 5.

### Inspirations
Dungeon Runner is the working title name, and takes inspiration from several games in various aspects:

1. _The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind_ // dungeons & world-map are unique (hand-crafted), and level-scaling is linear (does not scale with player level).
2. _Warframe_ // uses the "freemium" GaaS model using the F2P model, namely for in-game, playable items. As it is not PvP, pay-to-win only constitutes expediting player progression. Warframe also allows users to design in-game content (generally, cosmetic-only), and vetted content is sold with shares of profits going to the designer.
3. _League of Legends (2021)_ // also uses the freemium-GaaS model, mostly for cosmetics, as it is a PvP experience. Their IP also lends to profitable, external sales of bespoke products.
4. _Overwatch (pre-2018)_ // Overwatch uses a premium-GaaS model, where you buy a copy of the game, and updates are given for free. Players can buy lootboxes for cosmetics. This is an example of what _not_ to do. The inspirations to take are similar to League: it's a Hero Shooter, and while there are FPS elements, they are not stringent regarding recoil patterns or other subtle nuances in regular FPS gameplay.
5. _Divinity: Original Sin 2_ // D:OS2 has a simple, yet amply robust, element system for their game. For example, combining a Lightning spell on a terrain that's affected by Water will cause many types of objects and characters to be affected by a "Shocked" status effect. Similarly, Dungeon-Runner heeds from this style of game (including Dungeons & Dragons) by the application of status effects and its tracking for strategic gameplay.
6. _Apex Legends & Titanfall_ // Both games are first-person, high-intensity/action shooters, allowing for a low skill floor and high skill ceiling. Like Warframe, it brings in new players, but allows dedicated players to master its nuances ("tech" included). The Guard system, which will later be expounded on, is based on a stamina system combined with the Vortex Shield available in Titanfall. Apex Legends has a great mobility system that is intuitive, which extends to Titanfall.

# Section 1: Designer Suite
The Designer Suite is intended to be available to both players and designers with access to the software code. Its purposes are to provide both parties with the capability to design characters and their abilities in the context of the game, and later, to design frameworks for those characters to be played in (possibly in a variety of genres).

## List of Designer Suite Features

The following Designer Suite Features planned are:
1. Charactermancer (current)
2. Dungeon (Level) Designer
3. Narrative Designer
4. Objective Designer

# Section 2: Gameplay and Design
The current framework that all Designer Suite Features (DSFs) will be catered to is within the genre of: 3D RPG FPS (think Destiny).

The DSFs that will later be completed will enable this style of gameplay.
