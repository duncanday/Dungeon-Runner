# Dungeon-Runner
Dungeon Runner is a free-to-play (F2P), 2-10 player game, focusing on the PvE experience. Players will delve into dungeons (levels) and earn in-game rewards, and out-of-game rewards using Web3 Technology (DLT/Blockchains)

There are no current plans to introduce matchmaking or PvP experiences. If the framework proves viable, then the possibilities will be considered.

It will be finalized in a 3D engine. Currently, the engine of choice is Unity 5.

## Overarching Story
The release title will be "The Carbon Hearts."

In the world of "The Carbon Hearts," an endless war is in place. However, those engaged in battle are obligated to do so, after coming into contact with the world's powerful, yet corruptible material: AETHER.

Those who came in contact with AETHER became, to their loved ones..._something else._

For better, their powers grew, and they were able to use it for good or evil.

For worse, those touched by AETHER were envenomed by its power, and so, their powers would subside without more of it. Over time, their hearts would become a steely carbon, and over time, they became more machine than man.

For better or for worse.

## NFT integration
A novel concept of blockchain technology is the ability to tokenize a representative of a digital or real-world object as a "token." While many cryptocurrencies are _fungible_, meaning that a token (or tokenized represenation of "something") can be reminted and reissued, an NFT, or non-fungible token, cannot be reminted or reissued in its "truest" form by attaching a digital signature to the recipient/purchaser, and provide an immutable record of it on the blockchain.

NFTs have been explored in use cases regarding digital media, including games. In this project, NFTs will be integrated much like enjin.io handles NFTs (which allows NFTs to be transferred across games or "melted" back into its native coin, ENJ)

This game will use NFTs to create an immutable item that transform's the player character over time:
1. A participating player will be given a "Blank Carbon Heart" object which houses the consequences of all impacting decisions over time. They will be able to choose the gender and name for their character.
2. The player will be able to play the game with or without any amount of cryptocurrency. However, when cryptocurrency is used, it will transform the "Blank Carbon Heart" into the color associated with the accepted cryptocurrency (Gold for Bitcoin, Light Purple for Ethereum, White for Stellar Lumens, etc.)
3. Playing the game with cryptocurrency will allow for unique storylines to be experienced.

The player's character can die. The cause of death will transform their Carbon Heart into a usable relic, whose stats are chosen by the player on death.

The game is segmented into 4 seasons per year. In each season, a new chunk of DLC is released. Each season has its own challenging end, where it will test the player's skill to survive.

Survivors can carry their character over into the next season, or sacrifice their character in the challenging end, turning their Carbon Heart into a usable relic as mentioned above.

Usable Cryptocurrencies:
1. The native token to the chain that the game is integrated with (BTC/ETH/ALGO/DOT/ATOM/etc.) Wrapped versions are not allowed.
2. Fiat purchases are converted into stablecoins associated with the network. (for example, USDC/DAI with ETH, and UST with Terra Luna)

### Inspirations
Dungeon Runner is the working title name, and takes inspiration from several games in various aspects:

1. _The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind_ // dungeons & world-map are unique (hand-crafted), and level-scaling is linear (does not scale with player level).
2. _Warframe_ // uses the "freemium" GaaS model using the F2P model, namely for in-game, playable items. As it is not PvP, pay-to-win only constitutes expediting player progression. Warframe also allows users to design in-game content (generally, cosmetic-only), and vetted content is sold with shares of profits going to the designer.
3. _League of Legends (2021)_ // also uses the freemium-GaaS model, mostly for cosmetics, as it is a PvP experience. Their IP also lends to profitable, external sales of bespoke products.
4. _Overwatch (pre-2018)_ // Overwatch uses a premium-GaaS model, where you buy a copy of the game, and updates are given for free. Players can buy lootboxes for cosmetics. This is an example of what _not_ to do. The inspirations to take are similar to League: it's a Hero Shooter, and while there are FPS elements, they are not stringent regarding recoil patterns or other subtle nuances in regular FPS gameplay.
5. _Divinity: Original Sin 2_ // D:OS2 has a simple, yet amply robust, element system for their game. For example, combining a Lightning spell on a terrain that's affected by Water will cause many types of objects and characters to be affected by a "Shocked" status effect. Similarly, Dungeon-Runner heeds from this style of game (including Dungeons & Dragons) by the application of status effects and its tracking for strategic gameplay.
6. _Apex Legends & Titanfall_ // Both games are first-person, high-intensity/action shooters, allowing for a low skill floor and high skill ceiling. Like Warframe, it brings in new players, but allows dedicated players to master its nuances ("tech" included). The Guard system, which will later be expounded on, is based on a stamina system combined with the Vortex Shield available in Titanfall. Apex Legends has a great mobility system that is intuitive, which extends to Titanfall.

# Section 1: Designer Suite
The Designer Suite is intended to be available to both players and designers with access to the software code. Its purposes are to provide both parties with the capability to design characters and their abilities in the context of the game, and later, to design frameworks for those characters to be played in (possibly in a variety of genres).

## List of Designer Suite Features

The following Designer Suite Features planned are:
1. Charactermancer (current)
2. Dungeon/Level Designer
3. Item Designer

# Section 2: Gameplay and Design
The current framework that all Designer Suite Features (DSFs) will be catered to is within the genre of: 3D RPG FPS (think Destiny).

The DSFs that will later be completed will enable this style of gameplay.
